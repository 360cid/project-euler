# Problem 9
#
# A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,
# a^2 + b^2 = c^2
#
# For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2.
#
# There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
# Find the product abc.

def isTriplet(a,b,c):
    return pow(a,2) + pow(b,2) = pow(c,2)

def sumsTo1000(a,b,c):
    return a + b + c = 1000
